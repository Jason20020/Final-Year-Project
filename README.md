# Final-Year-Project
# Car Recognition Mobile Application
## Introduction
The idea of this project is to design a mobile application that will provide the user the ability to identify a car.  The user will initially take a picture of the car within the mobile app. The app will then process the image to determine various dimensions of the car. Based on this information the app will identify the make and model of the car, using the Resnet50 neural network and then return this information along with various other details to the user. 

The reason that I want to work on this project is because I could not find a good application in market that provides a car recognition function. I think this type of application is quite useful because there are many types of cars in the world nowadays and not everyone knows about all the cars. This application will make it easier for consumers to know more about the car they want to buy. Besides that, I wanted to gain understanding of mobile application development as this is not one of the modules I am currently studying.
